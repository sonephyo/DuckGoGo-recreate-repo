        <div class="FAQ">
            <div class="faq-question">How does DuckDuckGo make money?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">We make our money from private ads on our search engine. On other search engines, ads are based on profiles compiled
            about you using your personal information like search, browsing, and purchase history. Since we don’t collect that
            information, search ads on DuckDuckGo are based on the search results page you are viewing, not on you as a person. For
            example, if you search for cars, we’ll show you ads about cars. Learn more.</div>
            
            <div class="faq-question">What does Google know about me?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Not only does Google keep your search history forever by default, their trackers have been found on 75% of the top
            million websites, which means they are tracking most everywhere you go on the Internet (unless you stop them with
            DuckDuckGo!). And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Learn more.</div>
            
            <div class="faq-question">
                Why use DuckDuckGo instead of Google?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Ever notice ads constantly following you around? That’s in part because Google tracks your searches and hides trackers
            on millions of websites. By contrast, our private search engine doesn’t track your searches and our DuckDuckGo browser
            extension and mobile app block Google’s (and many other companies’) trackers across the Internet, helping to keep your
            browsing history more private, as it should be. And that’s just the beginning — by using DuckDuckGo you also escape the
            manipulation of the filter bubble and can use the Internet faster (after all that tracking code is disabled). Learn
            more.</div>

            <div class="faq-question">
            How do DuckDuckGo search results compare to Google’s?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">DuckDuckGo search gives you truly private search results without tradeoffs in result quality. We have everything you’ve
            come to expect in an online search experience, and a few bonus features that make searching the Internet not only
            private, but also a bit more fun! And, on top of that, because there is no search history on DuckDuckGo, you escape the
            filter bubble of manipulated results. Learn more.</div>

            <div class="faq-question">
                Is DuckDuckGo an “unfiltered” search engine?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">

                Unlike some other search engines, we don’t alter search results based on someone’s previous search history. In fact,
                since we don’t track our users we don’t have access to search histories at all! Those other search engines show you
                results based on a data profile about you and your online activity (including your search history), and so can be
                slanted towards what they think you will click on the most based on this profiling. This effect is commonly known as the
                search filter bubble, but using DuckDuckGo can help you escape it.
                
                This does not mean our search results are generally “unfiltered” because, for every search you make online, a search
                engine’s job is to filter millions of possible results down to a ranked order of just a handful. In other words, a
                search engine has to use algorithms programmed by people to determine what shows up first in the list of results, what
                shows up second, and so on. Otherwise, for every search you’d just get a completely random set of results, which of
                course wouldn’t be very useful.

            <div class="faq-question">
                Is DuckDuckGo owned by Google?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                No, we are not and have never been owned by Google. We have been an independent company since our founding in 2008 and,
                unlike some other search engines, we don’t rely on Google’s results for any of our search results. You may notice that
                we offer a Google Chrome extension and a Google Android app, but these are also not in partnership with Google and
                actually aim to protect you from Google’s online trackers.

            <div class="faq-question">
                What’s the difference between using DuckDuckGo and Incognito mode?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It is a myth that you can’t be tracked while using so-called “Incognito” mode. In fact, Incognito mode mainly just
            deletes information on your computer and does nothing to stop Google from saving your searches, nor does it stop
            companies, Internet service providers, or governments from being able to track you across the Internet. By contrast,
            DuckDuckGo search is completely anonymous and if you add our app & extension on top, we help keep you private when
            browsing off of search results. Learn more.</div>
